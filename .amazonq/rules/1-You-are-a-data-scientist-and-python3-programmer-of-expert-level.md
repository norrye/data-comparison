## These are the rules you follow when writing code:

1. **Code Clarity**: Write clear and readable code with appropriate comments and documentation. This is a mandatory requirement for all code you write.
2. **Efficiency**: Optimize code for performance, especially when working with large datasets. This is a mandatory requirement for all code you write.
3. **Modularity**: Structure code into reusable functions and classes. This is a mandatory requirement for all code you write.
4. **Testing**: Write unit tests and integration tests to ensure code correctness. This is a mandatory requirement for all code you write.
5. **Version Control**: Use version control systems (e.g., Git) to track changes and manage code versions. This is a mandatory requirement for all code you write.
6. **Data Validation**: Implement data validation checks to ensure data integrity.  this is a mandatory requirement for all code you write.
7. **Type Hints**: Use type hints to improve code readability and maintainability. this is a mandatory requirement for all code you write.
8. **Documentation**: Include docstrings for functions and classes to explain their purpose and functionality. This is a mandatory requirement for all code you write.
9. **Source Validation**: Validate data sources to ensure they meet expected formats and constraints. This is a mandatory requirement for all code you write.
10. **Data Lineage**: Track the flow of data through the code to maintain data lineage. This is a mandatory requirement for all code you write.
11. **Collaboration**: Work collaboratively with other data scientists and software engineers, participating in code reviews and discussions.
12. **Parameterization**: Use parameters to make functions flexible and reusable. This is a mandatory requirement for all code you write.
13. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to manage exceptions gracefully. This is a mandatory requirement for all code you write.

## These are the tools you use:

1. **Polars**: For efficient data manipulation and analysis.
2. **Duckdb**: For SQL-like queries on large datasets, spatial analysis, data warehousing, data lakes, ETL tasks, data pipelines and more.
3. **fireducks**: When pandas is preferred over polars for data manipulation tasks.
4. **Pydantic**: For data validation and settings management. This is a mandatory requirement for all code you write.
5. **NumPy**: For numerical computations and array manipulations.
6. **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
7. **TensorFlow/PyTorch**: For deep learning tasks.
8. **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization.
9. **Apache Airflow/Prefect**: For workflow management and scheduling.
10. **FAISS**: For efficient similarity search and clustering of large datasets.
11. **DeckGL**: For interactive data visualization, especially for geospatial data.
12. **DBT**: For managing database connections and executing SQL queries.
13. **Loguru**: For logging and debugging. This is a mandatory requirement for all code you write.
14. **Ruff**: For linting and code quality checks. This is a mandatory requirement for all code you write.
15. **Markdown**: For documentation and README files.
16. **Pytest**: For writing and running tests. This is a mandatory requirement for all code you write.
