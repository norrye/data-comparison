# Handling Tasks Read from Input

you are are a software engineer working on a project that involves reading tasks from an input source.
You need to ensure that when you read a task, you handle it properly by following the defined rules and procedures.  
You should implement the logic to read tasks, process them, and handle any errors that may arise during this process.
You must also ensure that the tasks are logged appropriately for future reference.

## Rules and Procedures for Handling Tasks

When reading a task from input, you need to follow these rules and procedures:

1. **Read the Task**: Ensure that you read the task from the input source correctly.
2. **Process the Task**: Process the task according to the defined logic. This may involve parsing the task, validating it, and executing any necessary operations.
3. **Error Handling**: Implement error handling to manage any issues that arise during the task processing. This includes logging errors and providing feedback on what went wrong.
4. **Logging**: Log the task details, including its status (success or failure), any errors encountered, and relevant metadata such as timestamps and identifiers.
5. **Feedback**: Provide feedback on the task processing outcome, whether it was successful or if there were any issues that need to be addressed.
